# Introduction
Written by Samuel Sverker, Jonathan NÃ¤slund.

Hash table comes from Samuel's Assignment 1.
Linked list comes from Jonathan's Assignment 1.
Utils comes from Jonathan's bootstrap labs.


# Responsibility
The program does not take responsibility of any char * that was NOT successfully inserted. Either with ioopm_store_add_merch, ioopm_store_edit_merch, ioopm_store_replenish_merch, ioopm_store_add_to_cart, and ioopm_store_remove_from_cart. If any of these functions returns an error code (negative integer) the char * will NOT be freed upon ioopm_store_destroy. As it doesn't exist within the ioopm_store_t.

# How to run
To build the program and run its tests, write "make build_store_test" at the directory of this README and ./build_store_test there after. 
To build the program without running the tests, write "make event_loop" and then ./event_loop.
To build the program and run its tests with valgrind, write "make mem_store_test".
To run all .c files, except files from "datastructures", with gcov, write "make gcov_tests"

Required files:
* datastructures/hash_table.h
* datastructures/linked_list.h
* datastructures/common.h
* datastructures/iterator.h
* business_logic/cart_hash_table.h
* business_logic/ioopm_store.h
* business_logic/merch_hash_table.h
* business_logic/shelf_list.h
* utils/utils.h

# Code profile
This code coverage has been gathered with help of gcov:
ioopm_store.c: 100%
merch_hash_table.c: 100%
cart_hash_table.c: 100%
shelf_list.c: 98.84%
utils.c: 23.94%

shelf_list.c has one return statement that cannot be reached due to the overarching structure but still needs to be included because the compiler will complain otherwise.
That which has not been covered in utils.c are functions that read from stdin.
